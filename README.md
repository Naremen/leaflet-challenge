# leaflet-challenge

# Introduction
  - In this challenge you will be using both HTML and JavaScript to complete your analysis.
  - In order to get your dataset you will need to visit the USGS website using this link:
    -http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

# Mapping
  - You will need to use the URL of the JSON to pull in the data for the visualization.
  - Using LEaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset bases on their longitude and latitude.
  - The dta markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquakes by their size and depth of the earthquake by color.
  - Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

# Additional Help
  - For this challenge I utilized my tutoring sessions to help progress me through this weeks challenge.
